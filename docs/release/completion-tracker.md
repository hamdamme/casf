# CASF completion tracker

Updated 10 November 2026. Target confirmed by the maintainer: experimental v0.1 for research and evaluation.

Audit baseline: `93ba4325675c948b108a0281c2b0d97c713decdc`. PR 51 is merged into main at `6441e4569e8c420f5e8a71e55950af88ce46f336`. The workflow and review batch starts from that revision and targets main directly. The original audit remains a record of its earlier baseline.

**Current position:** Phases 1–3 and Sessions 1–9 complete. Phase 4, Session 10 is awaiting review of the documented workflows and critical-change review. Additional Linux/cloud evaluation is deferred by the maintainer; Ubuntu CI continues.

**Progress:** 18/28 tasks complete; 10 remaining. 9/14 sessions complete; 5 remaining. 3/6 phases complete; 3 remaining, including the current phase.

These counts describe this completion plan, not the proportion of all historical project work. A session is a reviewable work package, not a fixed time estimate. Historical Phase 3 closeout is a separate record. Partial implementation and work awaiting review remain in the remaining totals.

## Acceptance and reporting

A task is complete when its stated acceptance check has passed and supporting evidence is recorded. Work awaiting required review is marked Awaiting review. Added tasks change the total explicitly; missing requirements are not silently dropped. Existing research and accepted review scope remain credited.

After every completed task, report: task ID and changes; checks actually run and results; current phase/session; completed and remaining task/session/phase counts; blockers; the user action required or “Nothing needed”; and the next task.

## Latest session summary

- PR 51 is merged. The bounded local research refresh and historical/current reconciliation have been accepted, completing F17–F18 and Session 9.
- F19: added a runnable 21-check synthetic workflow; clarified installed versus source environments, key provisioning and schema migration; corrected the Linux/cloud run sheets. The obsolete alternate runner was already removed in PR 30.
- F20: reviewed selected startup, retained-state, recovery, worker, storage, export and verification paths. Six regressions reproduced a legacy remote benchmark URL downgrade; unsupported URLs now fail before submission. The [review record](workflow-review-2026-11-10.md) identifies the inspected paths, fixes and limits.
- Local validation: 1199 tests, six traceability checks, lint across runtime/tests/benchmarks/examples, strict typing and lock check passed. The clean-source demo and first/repeated offline CLI verification passed. All twelve hosted configurations must pass for the PR revision.
- Preservation: 260 research/result/historical-document files are unchanged. No private real-document rerun, cloud provisioning or additional Linux/WAN benchmark is claimed. The maintainer deferred that separate environment evaluation.
- Remaining acceptance: review F19–F20 and CI. This review is scoped implementation review, not an independent security audit. Exact candidate artifacts, fresh installation acceptance and final advisory/license review remain separate.
- Remaining: 10 tasks, 5 sessions and 3 phases, including F19–F20 awaiting review. Accepting this batch completes Session 10 and Phase 4, leaving 8 tasks, 4 sessions and 2 phases.
- User action: review the workflow draft PR and its checks. Nothing is merged or released by this work.
- Next task after acceptance: Phase 5, Session 11 — prepare identified candidate packages and verify clean installations (F21–F22).

The dated repository audit and full file inventory were delivered in the maintainer's review workspace. They describe the baseline, not the post-fix branch.
